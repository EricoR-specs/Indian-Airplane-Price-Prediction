        This flight data analysis covers flight volume, popular routes, and the factors that influence ticket prices.

        **Flight Volume and Popular Routes:**
        * **Vistara** is the airline with the highest number of flights, followed by **Air India** and **Indigo**.
        * **Delhi** and **Mumbai** are the main flight hubs, with the highest volume of flights to and from other major cities like **Bangalore**.
        * The highest number of departures occurs in the morning.

        Flight ticket prices are not static and are influenced by several key factors:
        * **Airline Type:** Airlines can be grouped into two pricing categories:
            * **Low-Cost Carriers:** Such as **AirAsia**, **Indigo**, and **GO_FIRST**, have relatively stable and affordable prices.
            * **Full-Service Carriers:** Such as **Vistara** and **Air India**, have significantly higher prices and a more varied price range.
        * **Departure and Arrival Times:** Ticket prices vary depending on the combination of departure and arrival times.
        * **Distance Traveled:** Routes with longer distances, which require more fuel, tend to have higher ticket prices.
        * **Time of Booking:** The closer the purchase date is to the departure date, the more ticket prices tend to increase.

    st.write('### Model Selection and Performance')
    st.write(
        """
        To predict ticket prices, a variety of regression models were evaluated. Simple linear models like Linear Regression and Ridge Regression performed poorly due to the data's complex, non-linear nature. Advanced tree-based models, particularly **boosting models** like **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**, were far more effective at capturing these complex patterns.

        After comparing the models, **XGBoost** was selected as the best choice. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on the model to optimize its performance, resulting in the following final metrics:
        * **Mean RÂ² Score: 0.9787**
          This indicates that the model can explain approximately **98%** of the variance in ticket prices, signifying a very high level of accuracy.
        * **Mean Negative MSE: -10,948,750**
          This score shows that the model has a very low average prediction error, making it a reliable tool for forecasting airline ticket prices.
